    "Definition": "In this task, you will be given a sentence. You need to list the tokens that mentions names of the disorders or diseases. Disease is a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury. You should list the tokens in the same order that they appear in the text. If no information about the participants is mentioned, just output \"not found\".",
