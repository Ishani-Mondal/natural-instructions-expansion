    "Definition": "In this task, you are given a formal short text in English. You are expected to classify the text into two classes: humorous or non-humorous. A humorous sentence is one that has the ability to be amused by something seen, heard, or thought about, sometimes causing you to smile or laugh, or the quality in something that causes such amusement.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "We are all time travelers moving at the speed of exactly 60 minutes per hour.",

            "output": "non-humorous",
            "explanation": "This is a pretty straightforward remark which does not involve any amusement, hence it needs to be classified as non-humorous."
